Set the board with the layout 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4
A
Find the first bin that isn't empty and write down its index on the current line and make it the starting bin.
B
Pick up the stones from starting bin. 
Put 1 stone in the next bin, 1 in the bin after that, etcetera until hand is empty. That last bin becomes the starting bin
If the starting bin is the pot, write down the layout below the last index on the line and repeat from A
Else if the starting bin has 1 stone, remove its one stone and the stones from the bin opposite and add them to the pot. Write down the pot total for that sequence
go to the next line and write down the same exact sequence and layouts as the line before
Else repeat from B
C
Set the board so it matches the last layout written
Find the first non-empty bin located AFTER the last one whose index is listed at the end of the line.
If that non-empty bin is before the pot, replace the last index written down with this new bin's index to indicate that it is the next starting bin and repeat from B
Else, remove the last index written on the line and the last layout before that and repeat from C
